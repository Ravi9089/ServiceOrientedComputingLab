# Healthcare Data Management Assignment

This assignment consists of a web-based healthcare data management system. It allows you to input patient information through an HTML form, save the data as an XML file, and display it in a table. Additionally, there's a Java program to parse and manipulate the saved XML data.

1. Open the `healthcare.html` file in a web browser.
2. Fill in the patient information in the provided form.
3. Click the "Save Data and Display Table" button.
4. Patient data will be saved as `patient_data.xml` and displayed below the form.

### Running the Java Code:

1. Compile `ParseXML.java` using the following command:
2. Execute the compiled Java class:
3. Open the `patient_table.html` file in a web browser to view the patient data table.

## File Structure

- `healthcare.html`: The main HTML file for entering patient data.
- `ParseXML.java`: Java code for parsing and manipulating XML data.
- `patient_data.xml`: XML file where patient data is saved.
- `patient_table.html`: HTML file to display the patient data in a table.
